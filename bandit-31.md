Do the same old thing again

Okay now cloned it 

Follow the README

Then do a `git push origin master`. Explaining it term by term git push basically means "Yo my code is done. I am now sending this code to you(another user/ another branch) so that you can look at it and if possible merge it or make some changes to it yourself

coming to `origin`. Okay now we have something called as an `origin` and somethin called as an `upstream`. The way I look at them are what type of user are they

Origin means it's you

Upstream means it's someone else. Basically we use an upstream if we forked a repo from some account and want to make changes accordingly in our local(origin)

Okay I really needed to check where I need to push my code Origin/Upstream

So I do a `git remote -v` I get only one origin(lazy people).

And `master` since they told me to push the code to master branch

That's it. You will find the code somewhere in the push message
