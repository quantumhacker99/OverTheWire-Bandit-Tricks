OOF 30 levels up!!!

This is kinda the hardest level in git-part of Bandit
I personally did not know the solution for this. So I checked out the solution and found out that we should use `git tag`

Whaaaattt.. Whhaaaat is a `git tag`
I seriously didn't know what a `git tag` was. So went and researched a bit about tags in git https://git-scm.com/docs/git-tag
Turns out git tags are used to mark important changes in the code you made. Basically it is used to mark out versions.

So what's the advantage of this, you could always do a `git log` and check out all the commit changes and then revert back.

Gawwwd

Turns out tags are for lazy people who cant look at the list of all commits.

use `git tag`(dont ask me why)
then use basic git commands like `git show` which shows the tag message and the referenced objects.
And there you go, you have passed the worst level in this game
