This one is going to be way bigger than the previous ones, so buckle up.

Human readable here is taken to mean something in ASCII 

We are going to have to parse through files. So use the find command

Executable files - It's also called a binary file. The read-to-run version of a file. Like a.out in C or a .class file in Java
So clearly an executable file won't be in human readable format. Those reading this have probably experimented by opening an executable
at some point, only to get a bunch of gibberish symbols. So our first clue is to only look at non-executable files. Only those are human
readable.

In this exercise writing find ! -executable just displays all of them, meaning that we haven't narrowed down on anything. So we have to 
go further.

What else can we do? Notice that we've said human-readable contains ASCII text. So let's search for files which have ASCII text.

Grep command : It allows us to search for a given string in a given file.

Grep is going to be useful. We want to apply grep iteratively to all the files.

Xargs command - it builds and executes command lines from standard input.
xargs file means that we are taking it from the file instead

Additionaly file command determines the file type. It could also be useful.
